Below is a list of reviews of books on complex analysis.

<hr>
**Complex Variables and Applications**<br>
Brown, J. W., Churchill, R. V. (9th Ed. 2013). *ISBN 9780073383170*.<br>
*Prerequisites: Multivariable calculus*

This textbook does not go into too much depth in complex analysis, but provides more than enough to form a solid introduction. The majority of the textbook starting from the beginning is the part that goes over complex variables and the calculus of complex valued functions, up to the residue theorem, and some of the chapters near the end of the book are applications of complex variables to various topics in engineering and physics. This book is appropriate at the undergraduate level specifically, and is also appropriate for those studying engineering and physics.
