Below is a list of reviews of books on abstract algebra.

<hr>
**Basic Algebra I**<br>
Jacobson, N. (2nd Ed. 1985). [Free Download](http://www.math.toronto.edu/~ila/Jacobson-Basic_algebra_I%20(1).pdf){:target="_blank"}<br>
*Prerequisites: comfort with proof-based mathematics, basic linear algebr for some chapters.*

Very solid treatment of standard material in a two-semester abstract algebra sequence in the first four chapters, with good exposition and exercises. Contains and additional four chapters which go over less-standard material like lattices.

**Algebra**<br>
Lang, S. (3rd Ed. 2002). *ISBN 9780387953854*.<br>
*Proofwriting. Background in analysis will help with understanding some examples.*

Starts with the basics and rapidly builds up to cover a wide variety of topics, from group solvability to Galois Theory. This book is difficult to read without prior experience in algebra, and leaves a significant portion of the proofs as "exercise to the reader," despite many of them being highly nontrivial. However, used as a second textbook in algebra, its strength in the terseness of the proofs becomes apparent. A determined reader can cover significant amounts of material in a relatively short period of time using this book. The exercises in the book can be quite difficult, but they provide solid understanding of how to apply the theory from the preceding chapter.
