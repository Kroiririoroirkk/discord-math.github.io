Below is a list of reviews of books on ordinary differential equations.

<hr>
**Fundamentals of Differential Equations**<br>
Nagle, R., Saff, E., Snider, A. (9th Ed. 2017). *ISBN 9780321977069*.<br>
*Prerequisites: Single-variable calculus minimally, but strongly recommend multivariable calculus and linear algebra*

Basic ordinary differential equations theory, at a very low level. Admittedly the organization of the textbook is not the greatest and many of the methods are motivated suboptimally, but this is the reality of undergraduate ODE. Good source of exercises which are very much computational, and is okay for basic reference. Not recommended for self study due to the overall quality of writing. This book may be of interest for anyone studying any science.
