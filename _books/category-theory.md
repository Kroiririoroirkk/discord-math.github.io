Lurie, J., *et al*. [Free Download - Work in Progress](https://kerodon.net){:target="_blank"}\\
*Prerequisites: Category theory and modern algebraic topology (non-abelian cohomology, stable homotopy theory, etc.)*

Higher category theory (∞-categories et al.) applied to homotopy and homology. Detailed, sophisticated resource targeted at graduate students and researchers; introduces the higher categorical notions assuming just familiarity with standard 1-category theory. Pedagogically easier to follow than most of Lurie’s other work, but definitely not suitable for readers not already deeply familiar with category theory or algebraic topology. See also Lurie’s Higher Topos Theory, Higher Algebra, and Derived Algebraic Geometry sequence.
