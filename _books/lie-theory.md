Below is a list of reviews of books on Lie theory.

<hr>
**Naive Lie Theory**\\
Stillwell, J. (2008). *ISBN 9780387782140*.\\
*As the title suggests this is an introduction to Lie theory with minimal background requirements: linear algebra and some calculus.*

The classical Lie groups are introduced as rotations in two, three and four dimensions with a lots of appeal to geometric imagination, before discussing them in more general settings.
While other books on the topic rely on heavy theory rather quickly, this book presents a more elementary approach and makes this fascinating topic accessible to undergrads.
