title: Logic and Foundations

Below is a list of reviews of books on logic and foundations.

---
**A mathematical introduction to logic**\\
Enderton, H. B. (2nd ed. 2001). *ISBN 9780122384523*\\

The default introduction to mathematical logic. Good for beginning to intermediate undergrads, no knowledge of formal logic necessary, although prior exposure to elementary set theory (unions, intersections, etc) may be helpful. Relatively concise compared to Computability and Logic, and covers mostly only mathematical necessities.

**Computability and Logic**\\
Boolos, G. S., Burgess, J. P., Jeffery, R. C. (5th ed. 2007). *ISBN 9780521701464*.\\

Another good broad overview of logic. Approaches things from a theory of computational angle and covers more topics than Enderton. Directed at a broader audience, and readable to anyone who has some understanding of formal first order logic including philosophy and CS undergrads. Many chapters are skippable, and there is a lot of freedom in reading order. Topics range from elementary computability theory to Godel's incompleteness and independence of several combinatorial results.

**A Shorter Model Theory**\\
Hodges, W. (1997). *ISBN 9780521587136*\\

An general introduction to model theory, the study of the semantics of formal logic. Assumes some abstract algebra, but some exposure to combinatorics or set theory will be helpful. This book has an intended audience of graduate students but is approachable as early as a 3rd year of undergraduate.

**Reverse Mathematics**\\
Stillwell, J. (2018). *ISB 9780691177175*\\

A historical and mathematical introduction to the programs of arithmetization and reverse mathematics. Very short and concise text. Prior knowledge of real analysis is helpful. Topics covered range from the halting problem to analysis in various systems of arithmetic. The author has a clear vision of a narrative and follows it through, creating text that is a pleasure to read.
