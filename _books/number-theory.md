**An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers**\\
Niven, I., Zuckerman, H. S., Montgomery, H. L. (5th Ed. 1991). *ISBN 9780471625469*\\
*Prerequisites: minimally, calculus and comfort with proofs; but it helps to know linear and abstract algebra*

Kind of an old fashioned book, but it does the job well. The first few chapters are basically what one might see in an introductory course in number theory, and then the later chapters might follow in successive courses or even intro grad level courses, minus the use of heavy abstract algebra. This textbook is a decent way to introduce elementary number theory without the use of abstract algebra, and for that reason it could be valuable to take a look at prior to a first course in abstract algebra or concurrently with one.
