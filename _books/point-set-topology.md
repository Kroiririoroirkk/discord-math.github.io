title: Point-set Topology
---

Below is a list of reviews of books on point-set topology.

<hr>
**Notes on Introductory Point-Set Topology**\\
Hatcher, A. (2005). [Free Download](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/Top/TopNotes.pdf){:target="_blank"}\\
*Prerequisities: Basic set theory.*

Covers essential material in point-set topology over the course of about 40 pages, geared towards introducing the constructions and material needed for Hatcherâ€™s algebraic topology textbook. The notes are fairly chatty and more focused on giving the reader the bare minimum they need from point-set topology for algebraic topology, commutative algebra, or other fields.

<hr>
**Topology: A Categorical Approach**\\
Bradley, T-D., Bryson, T., Terilla, J. (2020). *ISBN 9780262539357*.\\
*Prerequisites: comfort with sets and sasic proof-based mathematics.*

This book is quite different from the others on this list, and might best be used in conjunction with one of the others. The book develops basic category theory and point-set topology at the same time, with a different and more modern perspective than point-set is usually introduced. Potentially obscure topological definitions are shown to be very natural and straightforward through their universal properties.
