**Partial Differential Equations**\\
Evans, L. C. (1998). *ISBN 9780821807729*.\\
*Prerequisites: Multivariable calculus for the first section, measure theory and functional analysis for chapter 5 onwards*

Evans is a solid PDEs book. The first section (chapters 2-4) corresponds mainly to material one would see in an undergraduate PDEs course, focusing on material that one can do without substantial functional analysis and measure theory. Chapter 5 is where the theory starts to pick up seriously and the requisite knowledge increases in a corresponding manner. Notable is Evansâ€™ focus on nonlinear PDEs and developing good theory for them which is something that a lot of books neglect. However, do note that Evans does not discuss the theory of distributions, so another book to supplement this may be desired.
