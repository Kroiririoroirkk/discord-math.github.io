**Calculus**\\
Stewart, J. (8th Ed. 2015). *ISBN 9781285740621*.\\
*High school algebra is recommended but there is a preliminary chapter for this.*

This textbook is ideal for anyone who wants a basic understanding of calculus and nothing more (so not much theory at all), though the real value comes from being able to do the exercises in the book (specifically ones labeled as more difficult, to make the most use of this book, aim to complete the majority of these). Covers single-variable as well as multivariable calculus.
